## Task A: Setup

I plan to work through this course in Debian on my desktop, and on the MacBook Pro. Both setups have a terminal, sufficiently recent versions of Python, and VSCode.

The only thing I'm adding is that I want the files for this course to be in a GitHub repository, so I can easily move between my desktop and the MacBook Pro.

## Task B: Doing the Assignment
