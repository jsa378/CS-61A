  <li>Submit with Phase 1 complete by <strong>Thursday, February 3</strong>, worth 1 pt.</li>
  <li>Submit with all phases complete by <strong>Thursday, February 10</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Try to attempt the problems in order, as some later problems will depend
on earlier problems in their implementation and therefore also when
running <code>ok</code> tests.</p>

<p>The entire project can be completed with a partner.</p>

<p>You can get 1 bonus point by submitting the entire project by
<strong>Wednesday, February 9</strong>.</p></blockquote>

<p>In this project, you will develop a simulator and multiple strategies
for the dice game Hog. You will need to use <em>control statements</em> and
<em>higher-order functions</em> together, as described in Sections 1.2 through
1.6 of <a href="http://composingprograms.com">Composing Programs</a>, the online textbook.</p>

<blockquote><p>When students in the past have tried to implement the functions without
thoroughly reading the problem description, they’ve often run into issues.
😱
<strong>Read each description thoroughly before starting to code.</strong></p></blockquote>


<h3 id="rules">Rules</h3>


<p>In Hog, two players alternate turns trying to be the first to end a turn with
at least 100 total points. On each turn, the current player chooses some number
of dice to roll, up to 10. That player's score for the turn is the sum of the
dice outcomes. However, a player who rolls too many dice risks:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Sow Sad</strong>. If any of the dice outcomes is a 1, the current player's score
  for the turn is <code>1</code>.</li>
</ul>


        <button id='toggle-1' class='btn btn-outline btn-lg alwaystoggle toggle'>
        Examples<noscript> (enable JavaScript)</noscript>
        </button>
        <div class="solution toggle-1">

<ul>
  <li><em>Example 1:</em> The current player rolls 7 dice, 5 of which are 1's. They
  score <code>1</code> point for the turn.</li>
  <li><em>Example 2:</em> The current player rolls 4 dice, all of which are 3's. Since
  Sow Sad did not occur, they score <code>12</code> points for the turn.</li>
</ul>

</div>

<p>In a normal game of Hog, those are all the rules. To spice up the game, we'll
include some special rules:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p><strong>Hefty Hogs</strong>. <strong>If the opponent's score is 0</strong> and the player chooses to roll zero dice, the player will get 1 point. However, <strong>if the opponent's score is not 0</strong>, a player who chooses to roll zero dice will
  gain points according to the following:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The opponent's score will be mapped to a series of functions
    to be applied to the player's score,
    starting from the rightmost digit (the one's place)
    and ending on the leftmost digit.</li>
    <li>Each digit from <code>0</code> to <code>9</code> corresponds to a pre-defined function,
    <code>f0</code> through <code>f9</code>.</li>
    <li>The result of this series of calls <strong>modulo 30</strong> is
    the amount of points the player receives for the turn.</li>
  </ul></li>
</ul>


        <button id='toggle-2' class='btn btn-outline btn-lg alwaystoggle toggle'>
        Examples<noscript> (enable JavaScript)</noscript>
        </button>
        <div class="solution toggle-2">

<ul>
  <li><p><em>Example 1:</em>
  The current player has 10 points.
  The opponent player has 32 points.
  The functions are applied in this order:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The rightmost digit of the opponent's score is <code>2</code>.</li>
    <li>The corresponding function, <code>f2</code>, is applied to <code>10</code>.</li>
    <li>The next digit of the opponent's score is <code>3</code>.</li>
    <li>The corresponding function, <code>f3</code>, is applied to the result of <code>f2(10)</code>.</li>
    <li>The points the current player gains is the result of that call, modulo 30:
    <code>f3(f2(10)) % 30</code>.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li><p><em>Example 2:</em>
  The current player has 33 points.
  The opponent player has 5439 points.
  The functions are applied in this order:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The rightmost digit of the opponent's score is <code>9</code>.</li>
    <li>The corresponding function,<code>f9</code>, is applied to <code>33</code>.</li>
    <li>And so on:</li>
    <li>Function <code>f3</code> is applied to the result of <code>f9(33)</code>.</li>
    <li>Function <code>f4</code> is applied to the result of <code>f3(f9(33))</code>.</li>
    <li>Function <code>f5</code> is applied to the result of <code>f4(f3(f9(33)))</code>.</li>
    <li>The points the current player gains is the result of that call, modulo 30:
    <code>f5(f4(f3(f9(33)))) % 30</code>.</li>
  </ul></li>
</ul>

</div>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Hog Pile</strong>. After points for the turn are added to the current player's score,
  if the one's digit (<code>ones_digit</code>) of the current player's score
  is the same as the one's digit of the opponent player's score,
  the current player gains an additional <code>ones_digit</code> points.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="final-product">Final product</h2>


<p>You can try out the online Hog GUI with the staff solution to the project
at <a href="https://hog.cs61a.org">hog.cs61a.org</a>. When you finish the project, you'll
have implemented a significant part of this game yourself.</p>


<h2 id="download-starter-files">Download starter files</h2>


<p>To get started, download all of the project code as a <a href="hog.zip">zip archive</a>.
Below is a list of all the files you will see in the archive once unzipped.
For the project, you'll only be making changes to <code>hog.py</code>.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>hog.py</code>: A starter implementation of Hog</li>
  <li><code>dice.py</code>: Functions for rolling dice</li>
  <li><code>hog_gui.py</code>: A graphical user interface (GUI) for Hog (updated)</li>
  <li><code>ucb.py</code>: Utility functions for CS 61A</li>
  <li><code>ok</code>: CS 61A autograder</li>
  <li><code>tests</code>: A directory of tests used by <code>ok</code></li>
  <li><code>gui_files</code>: A directory of various things used by the web GUI</li>
  <li><code>calc.py</code>: A file you can use to approximately test your final strategy
  (in progress)</li>
</ul>

<p>You may notice some files other than the ones listed above too—those are
needed for making the autograder and portions of the GUI work. Please do not
modify any files other than <code>hog.py</code>.</p>




<h2 id="logistics">Logistics</h2>



<!-- <p>Remember that you can earn an additional bonus point by submitting the
  project at least 24 hours before the deadline.</p> -->



<p>The project is worth 25 points.
24 points are for correctness
and 1 point is for submitting Phase 1 by the checkpoint date.</p>


<p>You will turn in the following files:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>hog.py</code></li>
</ul>

<p>You do not need to modify or turn in any other files to complete the
project. To submit the project, run the following command:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok --submit</code></pre>

<p>You will be able to view your submissions on the <a
  href="http://ok.cs61a.org">Ok dashboard</a>.</p>

<p>For the functions that we ask you to complete, there may be some
initial code that we provide. If you would rather not use that code,
feel free to delete it and start from scratch. You may also add new
function definitions as you see fit.</p>

<p><b>However, please do not modify any other functions or edit any files not
listed above</b>. Doing so may result in your code failing our autograder tests.
Also, please do not change any function signatures (names, argument order, or
number of arguments).</p>



<p>Throughout this project, you should be testing the correctness of your code.
It is good practice to test often, so that it is easy to isolate any problems.
However, you should not be testing <i>too</i> often, to allow yourself time to
think through problems.</p>

<p>We have provided an <b>autograder</b> called <code>ok</code> to help you
with testing your code and tracking your progress. The first time you run the
autograder, you will be asked to <b>log in with your Ok account using your web
browser</b>. Please do so. Each time you run <code>ok</code>, it will back up
your work and progress on our servers.</p>

<p>The primary purpose of <code>ok</code> is to test your implementations.</p>

<!-- <p>First, some of the test cases are <i>locked</i>. To unlock tests, run the
following command from your terminal:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok -u</code></pre>

<p>This command will start an interactive prompt that looks like:</p>

<pre>

Unlocking tests

At each "? ", type what you would expect the output to be.
Type exit() to quit

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 0 &gt; Suite 1 &gt; Case 1
(cases remaining: 1)

&gt;&gt;&gt; Code here
?
</pre>

<p>At the <code>?</code>, you can type what you expect the output to be. If you
are correct, then this test case will be available the next time you run the
autograder.</p>

<p>The idea is to understand <i>conceptually</i> what your program should do
first, before you start writing any code.</p>

<p>Once you have unlocked some tests and written some code, you can check the
correctness of your program using the tests that you have unlocked:</p>

<pre>python3 ok</pre>

<p>Most of the time, you will want to focus on a particular question. Use the
<code>-q</code> option as directed in the problems below.</p>  -->

<!-- <p>Second, there may be some test cases that are <i>hidden</i>. These test cases are
<b>not</b> run by the command:</p> -->

<!--<pre>python3 ok</pre>-->

<!-- <p>They are only run when you submit:</p> -->

<!-- <pre>python3 ok --submit</pre> -->

<!-- <p> We keep test cases hidden to ensure that you write your code with the intention
of solving the question at hand, not purely to pass the given tests. The hidden
tests will be run when you submit your project. You will receive an email with part of
the autograder results after submitting. However, the autograder has a 15 minute
cooldown period. If you submit before 15 minutes have passed, the autograder will
not run.</p> -->

<p>We recommend that you submit <b>after you finish each
problem</b>. Only your last submission will be graded. It is also useful for us
to have more backups of your code in case you run into a submission issue. <b>If you forget to submit, your last backup will be automatically converted to a submission. </b></p>

<!--<p>After you run this command, you will receive an email (to the address-->
<!--that you used to sign up for Ok) that has the output from all <i>failed</i>-->
<!--unlocked tests, including hidden tests, along with your score at the bottom. You-->
<!--can continue submitting until you pass all the tests. However, you will receive-->
<!--<b>at most one email every half hour</b>.</p>-->

<!--<p>This buffer period is meant for you and your partner to try and understand-->
<!--where your error comes from, and take some time to think through your code. We-->
<!--encourage you to do this for all projects.</p>-->

<!---
<p>If you are trying to debug a test failure, you can launch an interactive session
after the test is run with:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok &#x2d;q 05 &#x2d;i</code></pre>

<p>This will run the tests and launch an interactive session if a test does not
pass.</p>

<!--- <p>The <code>tests</code> folder is used to store autograder tests, so
<b>do not modify it</b>. You may lose all your unlocking progress if you
do. If you need to get a fresh copy, you can download the
<a href="hog.zip">zip archive</a> and copy it over, but you
will need to start unlocking from scratch.</p> -->

<p>If you do not want us to record a backup of your work or information about
your progress, you can run

<pre>python3 ok --local</pre>


With this option, no information will be sent to our course
servers.

If you want to test your code interactively, you can run

<pre> python3 ok -q [question number] -i </pre>

with the appropriate question number (e.g. <code>01</code>) inserted.
This will run the tests for that question until the first one you failed,
then give you a chance to test the functions you wrote interactively.</p>

<p>You can also use the debugging print feature in OK by writing

<pre> print("DEBUG:", x) </pre>

which will produce an output in your terminal without causing OK tests to fail
with extra output.

<h2 id="graphical-user-interface">Graphical User Interface</h2>


<p>A <strong>graphical user interface</strong> (GUI, for short) is provided for you.
At the moment, it doesn't work because you haven't implemented the
game logic. Once you complete the <code>play</code> function, you will be able
to play a fully interactive version of Hog!</p>

<p>Once you've done that, you can run the GUI from your terminal:</p>

<pre><code>python3 hog_gui.py</code></pre>


<h2 id="phase-1-rules-of-the-game">Phase 1: Rules of the Game</h2>


<p>In the first phase, you will develop the rules for the game of Hog.</p>


<h3 id="problem-0-0-pt">Problem 0 (0 pt)</h3>


<p>The <code>dice.py</code> file represents dice using non-pure zero-argument functions. These
functions are non-pure because they may have different return values each time
they are called. The documentation of <code>dice.py</code> describes the two different
types of dice used in the project:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A <strong>fair</strong> dice produces each possible outcome with equal probability.
  Two fair dice are already defined, <code>four_sided</code> and <code>six_sided</code>,
  and are generated by the <code>make_fair_dice</code> function.</li>
  <li>A <strong>test</strong> dice is deterministic: it always cycles through a fixed sequence
  of values that are passed as arguments.
  Test dice are generated by  the <code>make_test_dice</code> function.</li>
</ul>

<p>Before writing any code, read over the <code>dice.py</code> file and check your
understanding by unlocking the following tests.</p>

<pre style="margin-bottom:0;"><code class="nohighlight">python3 ok -q 00 -u<button id="copy-code-python3ok-q00-u" class="inline-copy-button"><div class="copy-tooltip"><span>Copy</span></div>✂️</a></code></pre>

<h3 id="problem-1-2-pt">Problem 1 (2 pt)</h3>


<p>Implement the <code>roll_dice</code> function in <code>hog.py</code>. It takes two arguments: a
positive integer called <code>num_rolls</code> giving the number of dice to roll and a
<code>dice</code> function. It returns the number of points scored by rolling the dice that
number of times in a turn: either the sum of the outcomes or 1 <em>(Sow Sad)</em>.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Sow Sad</strong>. If any of the dice outcomes is a 1, the current player's score
  for the turn is <code>1</code>.</li>
</ul>

        Examples<noscript> (enable JavaScript)</noscript>
        </button>
        <div class="solution toggle-4">

<ul>
  <li><em>Example 1:</em> The current player rolls 7 dice, 5 of which are 1's. They
  score <code>1</code> point for the turn.</li>
  <li><em>Example 2:</em> The current player rolls 4 dice, all of which are 3's. Since
  Sow Sad did not occur, they score <code>12</code> points for the turn.</li>
</ul>

</div>

<p>To obtain a single outcome of a dice roll, call <code>dice()</code>. You should call
<code>dice()</code> <strong>exactly <code>num_rolls</code> times</strong> in the body of <code>roll_dice</code>.</p>

<p>Remember to call <code>dice()</code> exactly <code>num_rolls</code> times
<strong>even if Sow Sad happens in the middle of rolling</strong>.
By doing so, you will correctly simulate rolling all the dice together.</p>

        </button>
        <div class="solution toggle-5">

<p>If the tests don't pass, it's time to debug. You can observe the behavior of
your function using Python directly. First, start the Python interpreter and
load the <code>hog.py</code> file.</p>

<pre><code>python3 &#x2d;i hog.py</code></pre>

<p>Then, you can call your <code>roll_dice</code> function on any number of dice you want.
The <code>roll_dice</code> function has a <a href="http://composingprograms.com/pages/14-designing-functions.html#default-argument-values">default argument value</a> for <code>dice</code> that is
a random six-sided dice function. Therefore, the following call to <code>roll_dice</code>
simulates rolling four fair six-sided dice.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; roll_dice(4)</code></pre>

<p>You will find that the previous expression may have a different result each time
you call it, since it is simulating random dice rolls. You can also use test dice
that fix the outcomes of the dice in advance. For example, rolling twice when you
know that the dice will come up 3 and 4 should give a total outcome of 7.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; fixed_dice = make_test_dice(3, 4)
&gt;&gt;&gt; roll_dice(2, fixed_dice)
7</code></pre>

<blockquote><p>On most systems, you can evaluate the same expression again by pressing the up
arrow, then pressing enter or return. To evaluate earlier commands, press the
up arrow repeatedly.</p>

<p>If you find a problem, you need to change your <code>hog.py</code> file, save it, quit
Python, start Python again, and then start evaluating expressions. Pressing
the up arrow should give you access to your previous expressions, even after
restarting Python.</p></blockquote>

<p>Continue debugging your code and running the <code>ok</code> tests until they all pass. You
should follow this same procedure of understanding the problem, implementing a
solution, testing, and debugging for all the problems in this project.</p>

<blockquote><p>One more debugging tip: to start the interactive interpreter automatically
upon failing an <code>ok</code> test, use <code>&#x2d;i</code>. For example, <code>python3 ok &#x2d;q 01 &#x2d;i</code> will
run the tests for question 1, then start an interactive interpreter with
<code>hog.py</code> loaded if a test fails.</p></blockquote>

<h2 id="phase-2-playing-the-game">Phase 2: Playing the Game</h2>



<h3 id="problem-5-5-pt">Problem 5 (5 pt)</h3>


<p>Implement the <code>play</code> function, which simulates a full game of Hog. Players
take turns rolling dice until one of the players reaches the <code>goal</code> score.
A turn is defined as one roll of the dice.</p>

<p>To determine how many dice are rolled each turn, each player uses their
respective strategy (Player 0 uses <code>strategy0</code> and Player 1 uses <code>strategy1</code>). A
<em>strategy</em> is a function that, given a player's score and their opponent's
score, returns the number of dice that the current player will roll in the turn.
Don't worry about implementing strategies yet; you'll do that in Phase 3.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Important:</strong>
Your implementation should only need to use a single loop; you don't need
multiple loops. This might not affect passing the test cases if your logic is
correct overall, but this could affect your <a href="../../articles/composition">composition</a> grade for the
project. Here's the section of the syllabus on composition for <a href="../../articles/about#projects">projects</a>.</p>

<p>Additionally,
each strategy function should be called only once per turn. This means you
only want to call <code>strategy0</code> when it is Player 0's turn and only call
<code>strategy1</code> when it is Player 1's turn. Otherwise, the GUI and some <code>ok</code>
tests may get confused.</p></blockquote>

<p>If a player achieves the goal score by the end of their turn, i.e. after
all applicable rules have been applied, the game ends. <code>play</code> will then
return the final total scores of both players, with Player 0's score first
and Player 1's score second.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Hints</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You should call the functions you have implemented already.</li>
  <li>Call <code>take_turn</code> with five arguments (don't forget to pass in the <code>goal</code>).
  Only call <code>take_turn</code> once per turn.</li>
  <li>Call <code>hog_pile</code> to determine if the current player will gain additional
  points due to Hog Pile, and if so, how many points.</li>
  <li>You can get the number of the next player (either 0 or 1) by calling the
  provided function <code>next_player</code>.</li>
  <li>You can ignore the <code>leader</code> variable and the <code>say</code> argument
  to the <code>play</code> function for now.
  You will use them in Problem 7.</li>
  <li>For the unlocking tests, <code>hog.always_roll</code> refers to the <code>always_roll</code>
  function defined in <code>hog.py</code>.</li>

<p>The GUI relies on your implementation, so if you have any bugs in your
code, they will be reflected in the GUI. This means you can also use
the GUI as a debugging tool; however, it's better to run the tests
first.</p>


<h3 id="commentary-functions">Commentary functions</h3>


<p>In the next few problems, you will implement a commentary function
that prints remarks about the game, such as:
<code>&quot;Player 0 takes the lead by 5&quot;</code>.</p>

<p>A commentary function takes three arguments:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Player 0's current score, <code>score0</code></li>
  <li>Player 1's current score, <code>score1</code></li>
  <li>The previous leading player (if applicable), <code>leader</code></li>
</ul>

<p>And returns two values:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The current leading player (if applicable)</li>
  <li>The message to be printed, or <code>None</code> if no message is to be printed</li>
</ul>

<p>A commentary function should have no side effects;
you'll later update <code>play</code> to call the commentary function
and print out the current turn's message when applicable.</p>


<h3 id="problem-6-2-pt">Problem 6 (2 pt)</h3>


<p>Implement <code>announce_lead_changes</code>,
a commentary function that tracks lead changes.
When the leading player changes, <code>announce_lead_changes</code> should return a message.
If there is no leading player (i.e. the two player's scores are the same)
or if there has been no change from the previous leading player,
then <code>announce_lead_changes</code> should return <code>None</code> for its message.</p>

<p>At the end of <code>announce_lead_changes</code>,
you should return two values:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The player (either 0 or 1) with the higher score (or <code>None</code> if the player's score and the opponent's scores are equal)</li>
  <li>The message to be printed (or <code>None</code> if no message should be printed)</li>
</ol>

<p>When there has been a change in the leading player,
<code>announce_lead_changes</code> should return a message.
The format of this message is very specific,
and your implementation should match the doctest provided.</p>

<p>Before writing any code, unlock the tests to verify your understanding of the question:</p><pre style="margin-bottom:0;"><code class="nohighlight">python3 ok -q 06 -u<button id="copy-code-python3ok-q06-u" class="inline-copy-button"><div class="copy-tooltip"><span>Copy</span></div>✂️</a></code></pre>

        </script>
        <br/>
<p>Once you are done unlocking, begin implementing your solution.

        </script>
        <br/>

<p>When you are done, you will see commentary in the GUI:</p>

<pre><code>python3 hog_gui.py</code></pre>

<p>The commentary in the GUI is generated by passing the following function as the
<code>say</code> argument to <code>play</code>.</p>

<pre><code>announce_lead_changes</code></pre>


<h3 id="problem-7-2-pt">Problem 7 (2 pt)</h3>


<p>Update your <code>play</code> function
so that the commentary function <code>say</code> is called at the end of each turn.
Whenever <code>say</code> is called, two things are returned: a new <code>leader</code> and a <code>message</code>.
The <code>leader</code> should be passed into <code>say</code> on the next turn as its third
argument.  If the <code>message</code> is not <code>None</code> and is not the empty string <code>&quot;&quot;</code>, it
should be <code>print</code>ed.</p>

<p>On the first turn, you can pass in the provided <code>leader</code>
as the third argument to <code>say</code>.
Each consecutive call to <code>say</code> will then rely on the return value of <code>say</code>
from the previous call.</p>

<p>For example, the function <code>say_scores</code> in <code>hog.py</code> is a commentary function
that simply announces both players' scores.
In this function, the <code>leader</code> argument is not used, but it is still returned.</p>

<pre><code>def say_scores(score0, score1, player=None):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;A commentary function that announces the score for each player.&quot;&quot;&quot;
    message = f&quot;Player 0 now has {score0} and now Player 1 has {score1}&quot;
    return player, message</code></pre>

<p>Great work! You just finished Phase 2 of the project!</p>

Celebrate, take a break, and switch roles!</p>


<h2 id="phase-3-strategies-of-the-game">Phase 3: Strategies of the Game</h2>


<p>In the third phase, you will experiment with ways to improve upon the basic
strategy of always rolling a fixed number of dice. First, you need to develop
some tools to evaluate strategies.</p>


<h3 id="problem-8-2-pt">Problem 8 (2 pt)</h3>


<p>Implement the <code>make_averaged</code> function, which is a higher-order function that
takes a function <code>original_function</code> as an argument.</p>

<p>The return value of <code>make_averaged</code> is a function that takes in the same
number of arguments as <code>original_function</code>. When we call this returned function
on arguments, it will return the average value of repeatedly calling
<code>original_function</code> on the arguments passed in.</p>

<p>Specifically, this function should call <code>original_function</code> a total of
<code>total_samples</code> times and return the average of the results of these calls.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Important:</strong>
To implement this function, you will need to use a new piece of Python syntax.
We would like to write a function that accepts an arbitrary number of arguments,
and then calls another function using exactly those arguments. Here's how
it works.</p>

<p>Instead of listing formal parameters for a function, you can write <code>*args</code>,
which represents all of the <strong>arg</strong>ument<strong>s</strong> that get passed into the
function. We can then call another function with these same arguments by
passing these <code>*args</code> into this other function. For example:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def printed(f):
...     def print_and_return(*args):
...         result = f(*args)
...         print(&#x27;Result:&#x27;, result)
...         return result
...     return print_and_return
&gt;&gt;&gt; printed_pow = printed(pow)
&gt;&gt;&gt; printed_pow(2, 8)
Result: 256
256
&gt;&gt;&gt; printed_abs = printed(abs)
&gt;&gt;&gt; printed_abs(&#x2d;10)
Result: 10
10</code></pre>

<p>Here, we can pass any number of arguments into <code>print_and_return</code> via the
<code>*args</code> syntax. We can also use <code>*args</code> inside our <code>print_and_return</code>
function to make another function call with the same arguments.</p></blockquote>

<p>Read the docstring for <code>make_averaged</code> carefully to understand how it
is meant to work.</p>

<h3 id="problem-9-2-pt">Problem 9 (2 pt)</h3>


<p>Implement the <code>max_scoring_num_rolls</code> function, which runs an experiment to
determine the number of rolls (from 1 to 10) that gives the maximum average
score for a turn. Your implementation should use <code>make_averaged</code> and
<code>roll_dice</code>.</p>

<p>If two numbers of rolls are tied for the maximum average score, return the
lower number. For example, if both 3 and 6 achieve a maximum average score,
return 3.</p>

<p>You might find it useful to read the doctest and the example shown in the doctest
for this problem before doing the unlocking test.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Important:</strong> In order to pass all of our tests, please make sure that you are
testing dice rolls starting from 1 going up to 10, rather than starting from 10 to 1.</p></blockquote>

        </script>
        <br/>

<p><strong>Running experiments:</strong></p>

<p>To run this experiment on randomized dice, call <code>run_experiments</code> using
the <code>&#x2d;r</code> option:</p>

<pre><code>python3 hog.py &#x2d;r</code></pre>

<p>For the remainder of this project, you can change the implementation
of <code>run_experiments</code> as you wish.  The function includes calls to
<code>average_win_rate</code> for evaluating various Hog strategies, but most of the
calls are currently commented out. You can un-comment the calls to try out
strategies, like to compare the win rate for <code>always_roll(8)</code> to the win rate
for <code>always_roll(6)</code>.</p>

<p>Some of the experiments may take up to a minute to run. You can always reduce
the number of trials in your call to <code>make_averaged</code> to speed up experiments.</p>

<p>Running experiments won't affect your score on the project.</p>

<h3 id="problem-10-1-pt">Problem 10 (1 pt)</h3>


<p>A strategy can try to take advantage of the <em>Hefty Hogs</em> rule by rolling 0 when
it is most beneficial to do so. Implement <code>hefty_hogs_strategy</code>, which returns 0
whenever rolling 0 would give <strong>at least</strong> <code>threshold</code> points and returns
<code>num_rolls</code> otherwise.</p>

        <br/>

<p>Once you have implemented this strategy, change <code>run_experiments</code> to evaluate
your new strategy against the baseline. Is this strategy an improvement
over the baseline?</p>


<h3 id="problem-11-1-pt">Problem 11 (1 pt)</h3>


<p>A strategy can also take advantage of the <em>Hog Pile</em> rules.  The Hog Pile
strategy always rolls 0 if doing so triggers the rule and earns a nonzero
amount of points. In other cases, it rolls 0 if rolling 0 would give <strong>at
least</strong> <code>threshold</code> points.  Otherwise, the strategy rolls <code>num_rolls</code>.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Hint</strong>:
You can use the function <code>hefty_hogs_strategy</code> you defined in Problem 10.</p>

<p><strong>Hint</strong>:
Remember that the <code>hog_pile</code> check should be done after the points from
<code>hefty_hogs</code> have been added to the score.</p></blockquote>

<h3 id="optional-problem-12-0-pt">Optional: Problem 12 (0 pt)</h3>


<p>Implement <code>final_strategy</code>, which combines these ideas and any other ideas you
have to achieve a high win rate against the baseline strategy. Some
suggestions:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>hefty_hogs_strategy</code> or <code>hog_pile_strategy</code> are default strategies you can
  start with.</li>
  <li>If you know the goal score (by default it is 100), there's no point in
  scoring more than the goal. Check whether you can win by rolling 0, 1 or 2
  dice. If you are in the lead, you might decide to take fewer risks.</li>
  <li>Choose the <code>num_rolls</code> and <code>threshold</code> arguments carefully.</li>
  <li>Take the action that is most likely to win the game.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can check that your final strategy is valid by running <code>ok</code>.</p>

<pre style="margin-bottom:0;"><code class="nohighlight">python3 ok -q 12<button id="copy-code-python3ok-q12" class="inline-copy-button"><div class="copy-tooltip"><span>Copy</span></div>✂️</a></code></pre>

<p>You can also play against your final strategy with the graphical user
interface:</p>

<pre><code>python3 hog_gui.py</code></pre>

<blockquote><p>Note: The GUI has been updated. See the announcement at the top of
the page for instructions.</p></blockquote>

<pre><code>python3 ok</code></pre>

<p>You can also check your score on each part of the project:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok &#x2d;&#x2d;score</code></pre>

by participating in the Hog Contest, where you play your <code>final_strategy</code>
against those of other students. The winning strategies will receive extra
credit and will be recognized in future semesters!</p>

<p>To see more, read the <a href="https://cs61a.org/proj/hog_contest">contest description</a>. Or check out
the <a href="https://hog-contest.cs61a.org">leaderboard</a>.</p>

<!--
You will also be able to check your exact final win rate by running:

<pre><code>python3 calc.py</code></pre>

This should pop up a window asking for you to confirm your identity, and then
it will print out a win rate for your final strategy.
