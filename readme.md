This repository contains resources for the following versions of UC Berkeley CS 61A:

* Spring 2022
* Spring 2024
* Summer 2024
* Fall 2024 (to be added in December 2024).

The Spring 2024 directory mostly contains my work through roughly the first half of the course, which I'm no longer able to continue. The other directories contain (or will contain) the results of running `wget -r` on the relevant websites. See the `readme.md` files in each directory for more information.
